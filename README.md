Passworder is a password manager offering secure storage and offline cross device password access.

## Purpose?

It provides resolution to two major problems faced by users concerned
about their online privacy: memorizing secure passwords and accessing stored passwords across
all of their devices. The former is addressed by offering secure storage of passwords; and the
latter is addressed by generating passwords based on a master password. 
As passwords can be predictably generated (based on the master password) across devices, this essentially eliminates
the need of using a database/internet connection to sync passwords. Users can unlock the
password manager either by entering the master password, or by using their fingerprint. Lastly,
the password manager will allow users to view the strength of their master password and warn
them against using commonly used passwords.
